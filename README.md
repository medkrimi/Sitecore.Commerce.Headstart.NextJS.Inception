## Getting Started

Getting started with the Sitecore Commerce application is as simple as creating a feature branch from the development branch. When you are done with your feature release create a Pull Request that can be reviewed by the SE team.  We have set up the Main branch to automatically deploy to our Vercel hosted applicaiton once a merge is complete. We will manually merge development into Main when we are ready to deploy new features. 

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/lib/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.


## Existing Code as an Example  

There is a project on OrderClouds GitHub repo called HeadStart Next.
https://github.com/ordercloud-api/headstart-nextjs

The above project was written for a seller application but should give you a example of how the calls work within react using hooks and redux. The code is well laid out and can jump start you getting going with React and OrderCloud.
