## Existing Code as an Example  

There is a project on OrderClouds GitHub repo called HeadStart Next.
https://github.com/ordercloud-api/headstart-nextjs

The above project was written for a buyer application but should give you a example of how the calls work within react using hooks and redux. Some of the calls use the Me end point which will limit the returned items to only what is part of your buying group. Even though it is not a one for one comparison you can easily change the calls to return the entire items based on being an admin. The code is well laid out and can jump start you getting going with React and OrderCloud.
