## STEP 2. Deploy the application
### OPTION 1: Using Vercel
Using the Deploy Button below, you'll deploy on Vercel the Next.js project as well as connect it to your Sitecore Commerce Order Cloud sandbox.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FSitecoreNA%2Fsitecore-commerce%2Ftree%2Fmain)

### OPTION 2: Working locally
1. Pull the latest version from this github repository
2. Copy the `.env.local.example` file in the root directory to `.env.local` (ignored by default during your next Git commit):

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Then set each variable on `.env.local`:
`NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` Application Name used on Page title. 
`NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_CLIENT_ID` ClientID from portal.ordercloud.io  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_API_URL`='https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io' Sandbox URL from portal.ordercloud.io  
`NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_MARKETPLACE_ID` 
`NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_MARKETPLACE_NAME`

NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_CLIENT_ID='****0BAC-****-4711-B01F-1A**4F7*****'
NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_API_URL='https://sandboxapi.ordercloud.io'
NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_MARKETPLACE_ID='SitecoreCommerce'
NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_MARKETPLACE_NAME='Sitecore Commerce'
NEXT_PUBLIC_OC_USELIVEANALYTICSDATA='false'
```

3. Run Next.js in development mode
```bash
yarn install
yarn dev
```

If it doesn't work, post on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/medkrimi/commercenext.js/discussions).
